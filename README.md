This repository consist of the code related to the natural language processing projects.

Project 1. Natural Language Processing Of Movie Reviews using NLTK - This project consist of the code for doing the semantic analysis for the movie reviews out of 2000 reviews which are the words that decides that the movie is having positive review or negative one. I used the nltk library of python for the same. First we start from importing the data and nltk library. Then we do tokenization of the keywords. Then we find the frequency of the keywords. Then we train the model with Naive Bayes classifier of the nltk library with 80 percent of the data. Then test its accuracy using remaining 20 percent of the data. And resultant accuracy of the model is around 70 percent. So, You can check the code in the file named 1.Natural Language Processing Of Movie Reviews using NLTK.ipynb and use it to do some experiments on your own.
